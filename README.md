An experimental implementation of [Unity Catalog] in Rust.

THe reference implementation of unity catalog aims to be a fully self-contained
implememntaion of the Unity Catalog API. While this implementation also
provides a standalone server the primary goal is to provide a toolset that
allows integrators to customize the implementation to their needs or partially
adopt specific API surfaces.
